# MatlabFall18

#Here lies the matlab code from my freshman Intro to Mechanical Engineering course at UMass Lowell Fall of 2018
#To future viewers taking the course, try to use this as a reference, you get out of the course what you put in
#Use your TAs and classmates to make sure you really understand what your code is doing
